## Part 1a
1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. Error: result is not defined. Since we used let in the if statement to declare result.
5. values added: 0
6. Error: result is not defined. Since we used const in the if statement to declare result.

## Part 1b
1. Prints 3, since length = 3 and for loop runs till i < length.
2. Prints 150, since discountedPrice at the end of for loop = 150.
3. Prints 150, since finalPrice at the end of the for loop = 150.
4. Returns [50, 100, 150], since discounted array has the values 50, 100, and 150 pushed in the for loop.
5. Error: i is not defined. Since we use let, i only exists in the for loop.
6. Error: discountedPrice is not defined. Since we use let, discountedPrice only exists in the for loop.
7. Prints 150, since finalPrice at the end of the for loop = 150.
8. Returns [50, 100, 150], since discounted array has the values 50, 100, and 150 pushed in the for loop.
9. Error: i is not defined. Since we use let, i only exists in the for loop.
10. Prints 3, since length = 3.
11. Returns [50, 100, 150], since discounted array has the values 50, 100, and 150 pushed in the for loop.
12. A: student.name B: student['Grad Year'] C: student.greeting(); D: student['Favorite Teacher'].name E: student.courseLoad[0]\
13. A: '32' B: 1 C: 3 D: '3null' E: 4 F: 0 G: '3undefined' H: NaN
14. A: true B: false C: true D: false E: false F: true
15. A regular equality check == checks the equality with type conversion. A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.

17. [2, 4, 6]. The function modifyArray is called. The for loop takes the first element in the array which is 1 and calls doSomething which returns 1 * 2 = 2 and adds it to the newArr. Then the second element in the array which is 2 is called into doSomething which returns 2 * 2 = 4 and adds it to the newArr. Lastly, the third element in the array which is 3 is called into doSomething which returns 2 * 3 = 6 and adds it to the newArr. Then it returns newArr which contains [2, 4, 6].
